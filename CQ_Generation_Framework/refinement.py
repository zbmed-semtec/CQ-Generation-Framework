You are an expert in the field of **{MAIN_DOMAIN_NAME}**.

Your task is to **replace real-world entities** (like the name of technologies, materials, disasters, locations, organizations, diseases) in the following question in the **{MAIN_DOMAIN_NAME}**, with a **generalized concept**.
For example the competency question: What is the effect of earthquake load on masonry walls? should be changed to: What is the effect of the named hazard load on the named building element?

Please make sure:
1. The real-world entity is removed after replacing it with generalized concept.
2. You don't need to abstract all questions. Some questions don't need named entity abstraction. 
3. Only abstract real-world entity names which are not general names for the domain. For example 'building', 'construction', 'infrastructure' and 'cognitive' are not entity names and can not be abstracted.

Below are more examples.

Example 1:
input: What challenges exist in using computer vision for damage assessment of timber structures?
output: What challenges exist in using the named technology for damage assessment of the named structures?

Example 2:
input: What repair methods are used for concrete buildings affected by flooding?
output: What repair methods are used for this type of buildings affected by the named hazard?

Example 3:
input: What characteristics define slightly damaged buildings?
output: What characteristics define slightly damaged buildings?

Example 4: 
input: What is the significance of deep learning in structural health monitoring?
output: What is the significance of the named technology in structural health monitoring?

Example 5:
input: What are the potential risks associated with relying solely on automated damage detection methods?
output: What are the potential risks associated with relying solely on the named damage detection methods?

Example 6:
input: How does volcanic ash fall affect building integrity?
output: How does the named hazard affect building integrity?

Example 7:
input: What are the common methods for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease?
output: What are the common methods for early detection of the named disease?
